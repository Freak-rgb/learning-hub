# GCTU IT Learning Hub

Welcome to the GCTU IT Learning Hub project. This website serves as an educational portal for technology students, bridging the gap between academic theory and industry application.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following pages:

*   **index.html**: The main landing page welcoming users to the hub.
*   **about.html**: Information about the mission and vision of the Learning Hub.

*   **contact.html**: A contact form and address details for inquiries.
*   **style.css**: The main stylesheet controlling the look and feel of the website.

## Color Scheme

The design utilizes a professional and high-contrast color palette:
*   **Blue-Black (#001f3f)**: Used for headers, footers, and primary accents.
*   **White (#ffffff)**: Used for the main content background and text on dark backgrounds.
*   **Black (#333333)**: Used for primary body text.

## How to Run
